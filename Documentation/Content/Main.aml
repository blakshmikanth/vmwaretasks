    The VMWare SDKs offer a rich set of programmable interfaces that enable developers to drive virtual machines programmatically with an asynchronous,
    job-based programming model. Unfortunately that turns out to be too complicated for 99.9% of scenarios and most developers want to use a simple
    object-oriented interface for common VMWare tasks. The VMWareTasks library implements that interface and makes programming against virtual machine a no brainer.
